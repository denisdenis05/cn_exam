Create questions with multiple choice answers (one or more choices) or by inputing text. The output should be a json, like this
[{
    "question": "Question",
    "answers": [],
    "correct": "correct text",
    "image": "public/images/network_diagram_R1R2R3traceroute.png"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one is true:",
    "answers": [
      "when passing through each switch and hub in order to ensure consistency",
      "on each router",
      "on the source and destination hosts",
      "every time a router believes the packet has been altered"
    ],
    "correct": "bc"
  },
  ...
]
Generate a list of at least 20 questions out of the data I send, then repeat the questions in a reformulated way. If there should be an image, put the URI there.
